## Creating a new Template Variable

Once Image+ is installed, you can create Template Variables [TV] in the normal
way, but instead of setting the **Input Type** in Input Options to *Image*,
select *Image+* instead.

For most use cases, you should also set the **Output Type** in Output Options to
*Image+*. This allows you to control the image output on a resource.

## The cropping tool

When using an *Image+* TV, you could select an image exactly the same way as in
a normal *Image* TV. Once an image is selected, a cropping window is displayed
and you could select the area of the image to use. The original image is not
changed and so you can upload a single image, and re-use it in several places at
different sizes (and crops with multiple Image+ TVs) around the site.

If you want to change the cropping area, you have to click on the crop trigger
of the Image+ TV.

In the cropping window you have to drag the handles of the dotted box to change
the cropping area. If the TV was configured with size constraints or an aspect
ratio, the crop area will be restricted to match this aspect ratio.
