## Install from MODX Extras

Search for Image+ in the Package Manager of your MODX installation and install
it in there.

## Manual installation

If you can't access the MODX Extras Repository in your MODX installation, you
can manually install Image+.

* Download the transport package from [MODX Extras](http://modx.com/extras/package/imageplustvinput) (or one of the pre built transport packages in [_packages](https://github.com/Jako/ImagePlus/tree/master/_packages))
* Upload the zip file to your MODX installation's `core/packages` folder or upload it manually in the MODX Package Manager.
* In the Package Manager of your MODX installation select 'Search locally for packages' from the dropdown button.
* Image+ should now show up in the list of available packages. Click the corresponding 'Install' button and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

## Build it from source

To build and install the package from source you could use [Git Package
Management](https://github.com/TheBoxer/Git-Package-Management). The GitHub
repository of Image+ contains a
[config.json](https://github.com/Jako/ImagePlus/blob/master/_build/config.json)
to build that package locally. Use this option, if you want to debug Image+
and/or contribute bugfixes and enhancements.
