## Features

With this MODX Revolution custom template variable an image could be cropped
while maintaining the original image. The dimensions for the image can
(optionally) be configured to constrain a minimal width and/or height. The image
crop could be forced to remain at a pre-set ratio. A graphical tool could be
used to crop the image to the required dimensions/proportions.
